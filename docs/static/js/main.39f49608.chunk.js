Cyberbullying and cyberharassment are also known as online bullying. It has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers. Cyberbullying is when someone, typically teens, bully or harass others on the internet, particularly on social media sites. Harmful bullying behavior can include posting rumors, threats, sexual remarks, a victims' personal information, or pejorative labels (i.e. hate speech). Bullying or harassment can be identified by repeated behavior and an intent to harm.Victims may experience lower self-esteem, increased suicidal ideation, and a variety of negative emotional responses, including being scared, frustrated, angry, and depressed. <br><br>\n\nAwareness in the United States has risen in the 2010s, due in part to high-profile cases. Several US states and other countries have laws specific to cyberbullying. Some are designed to specifically target teen cyberbullying, while others use laws extending from the scope of physical harassment. In cases of adult cyberharassment, these reports are usually filed beginning with local police.\nResearch has demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimization.<br><br>\n\nInternet trolling is a common form of bullying over the Internet in an online community (such as in online gaming or social media) in order to elicit a reaction, disruption, or for someone's own personal amusement. Cyberstalking is another form of bullying or harassment that uses electronic communications to stalk a victim; this may pose a credible threat to the victim.<br><br>\n\nNot all negative interaction online or on social media can be attributed to cyberbullying. Research suggests that there are also interactions online that result in peer pressure, which can have a negative, positive, or neutral impact on those involved.<br><br>\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying"},{title:"Phishing",bread:"Phishing is the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords and credit card details by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.Typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, it often directs users to enter personal information at a fake website which matches the look and feel of the legitimate site.<br><br>\n \nPhishing is an example of social engineering techniques being used to deceive users. Users are often lured by communications purporting to be from trusted parties such as social web sites, auction sites, banks, online payment processors or IT administrators.<br><br>\n \nAttempts to deal with phishing incidents include legislation, user training, public awareness, and technical security measures (the latter being due to phishing attacks frequently exploiting weaknesses in current web security).<br><br>\n\nSource:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing"},{title:"Cyber predators",bread:"Online predators are individuals who commit child sexual abuse that begins or takes place on the Internet.<br><br>\n\nInternet-facilitated sex crimes against minors involve deceit and begin with adults communicating with children over the Internet with the goal of coercing them into illegal sexual activity. Sometimes the sexual abuse happens face to face.<br><br>\n\nChat rooms, instant messaging, Internet forums, social networking sites, cell phones, and even video game consoles have issues with online predations. These online areas attract predators because they allow them to have access to make contact with victims without drawing attention. In addition, there is insufficient reliable data concerning the number of minors sharing personal information online due to children's privacy issues. Also, the anonymity of online conversations leads to the disinhibition of minors, making them feel more comfortable and more likely to engage in risky behaviors. This allows predators to use manipulation to put their targets into situations where they will comply with the predator's sexual demands. Initial manipulation often involves introducing the minors to sexual activity, showing them pornography, and requesting sexually explicit information and pictures. This online predatory behavior does not often lead to offline contact.<br><br>\n\nEven though it is the mainstream view that predators will use distinct tactics to meet victims, most actual in-person meetings do not involve any deception. In fact, the minors are usually complicit with perpetrators often using promises of love and romance to seduce victims to meet.<br><br>\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_predator"}],R=function(){var e=Object(n.useState)(null),a=Object(s.a)(e,2),t=a[0],r=a[1],o=B();return i.a.createElement("div",null,M.map((function(e,a){return i.a.createElement("div",{key:e.title},i.a.createElement(j.a,{onClick:function(){return r(a)},className:o.button},e.title))})),(0===t||!!t)&&i.a.createElement(F,{title:T()(M,[t,"title"]),bread:T()(M,[t,"bread"])}))},A=Object(c.a)((function(e){return{root:{minHeight:"100vh",flexGrow:1},tab:{textDecoration:"none",fontSize:"1rem",opacity:1,color:"rgba(0,0,0,0.7)"},indicator:{backgroundColor:"transparent"},activeTab:{fontSize:"1rem",opacity:1,color:"rgba(0,0,0,1)",textDecoration:"underline"},contentContainer:{maxWidth:"800px",margin:"0 auto"}}})),H=function(){return-1!==window.location.hash.indexOf("play")?1:-1!==window.location.hash.indexOf("databank")?2:0};var W=function(){var e=A(),a=i.a.useState(H()),t=Object(s.a)(a,2),n=t[0],r=t[1],o=function(e,a){r(a)};return i.a.createElement("div",{className:e.root},i.a.createElement(l.a,{style:{backgroundColor:"transparent",boxShadow:"none"},position:"static"},i.a.createElement(m.a,{classes:{indicator:e.indicator},style:{backgroundColor:"transparent"},value:n,onChange:o},i.a.createElement(d.b,{className:e.tab,onClick:function(){return o(0,0)},to:"/"},i.a.createElement(u.a,{className:0===H()?e.activeTab:e.tab,label:"Home"})),i.a.createElement(d.b,{className:e.tab,onClick:function(){return o(0,1)},to:"/play"},i.a.createElement(u.a,{className:1===H()?e.activeTab:e.tab,label:"Play"})),i.a.createElement(d.b,{className:2===H()?e.activeTab:e.tab,onClick:function(){return o(0,2)},to:"/databank"},i.a.createElement(u.a,{className:e.tab,label:"Databank"})))),i.a.createElement("div",{className:e.contentContainer},i.a.createElement(h.a,{exact:!0,path:"/"},i.a.createElement(N,null)),i.a.createElement(h.a,{path:"/play"},i.a.createElement(S,null)),i.a.createElement(h.a,{path:"/databank"},i.a.createElement(R,null))))},q=t(129),z=t(52),P=Object(z.a)({palette:{type:"light"},typography:{body1:{fontFamily:"Montserrat"},body2:{fontFamily:"Montserrat"},h1:{fontFamily:"Morl",color:"#775BE4"},h2:{fontFamily:"Morl",color:"#775BE4"},h3:{fontFamily:"Morl",color:"#775BE4"},h4:{fontFamily:"Morl",color:"#775BE4"},h5:{fontFamily:"Morl",color:"#775BE4"},h6:{fontFamily:"Morl",color:"#775BE4"},button:{fontFamily:"Montserrat"},caption:{fontFamily:"Montserrat"}}}),_=Object(c.a)((function(e){return{container:{backgroundColor:"#FC8770",height:"200px"},copyright:{lineHeight:"200px"}}})),D=function(){var e=_();return i.a.createElement("div",{className:e.container},i.a.createElement(p.a,{className:e.copyright,align:"center"},"Copyright \xa9 Team Arnold"))},U=Object(c.a)((function(e){return{app:{textAlign:"center",maxWidth:e.breakpoints.values.md,margin:"0 auto"}}}));var Y=function(){return U(),i.a.createElement(d.a,null,i.a.createElement(q.a,{theme:P},i.a.createElement(W,null),i.a.createElement(D,null)))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));o.a.render(i.a.createElement(Y,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()}))},49:function(e,a,t){e.exports=t.p+"static/media/Card1.71981406.png"},50:function(e,a,t){e.exports=t.p+"static/media/Answer1.2109129a.png"},55:function(e,a,t){e.exports=t(106)},60:function(e,a,t){}},[[55,1,2]]]);
